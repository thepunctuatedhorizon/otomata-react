# otomata-react
Otomata was a flash game that built on a mathematical idea of cellular automaton and with a surprisingly few amount of items, produce chaotic (not predictable - as opposed to bad) patterns. Put a few music notes on that and it is awesome. Unfortunately, the internet forgot about this, I want to resurrect it.
